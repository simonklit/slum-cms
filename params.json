Download the Slum CMS source, and place it in a folder anywhere on your server. Could be \"slum\" at the webroot, but that is optional.\r\n\r\n##Initial Configuration##\r\n 1. Login by going (with your browser) to the directory in which you have placed Slum CMS, and using the following login information: Username: *rootuser* Password: *1234*.\r\n 2. Click \"Manage Users\"\r\n 3. Add a new user with the desired information\r\n 4. Go to the db/users.json file, and add \"priv\": \"root\" to the newly created user. It is important that you add a comma after the password line. Make it look identical (except for actual username and password) to the entry above, the one with rootuser.\r\n 5. Move the users.json file to a newly created directory, and rename it. Change the information accordingly in the \"config.php\" file. (This is **important** for security reasons)\r\n\r\n##Usage##\r\n\r\nIn the HTML of the pages:\r\n\r\n 1. Add the class \"slum\" to the elements on your pages that you want Slum CMS to edit.\r\n 2. Add the attribute slumtitle=\"\" if you want to add a title to the elements. This makes them easier to identify when changing them in Slum.\r\n 3. *Optional:* Add textarea=\"plain\", if you do not want this element to be rendered in a WYSIWYG editor. Recommended for elements like title and so.\r\n\r\nIn Slum CMS:\r\n\r\n 1. Log in as a user with root privileges to manage pages. Click \"Manage Pages\".\r\n 2. Add the desired name of the page.\r\n 3. In the path textfield, type in the path to the page you want to edit. This goes from the serverroot (webroot), of your server. So, if the page pizza.html is located in the folder Pages on the root of your server, it would be pages/pizza.html that you put in the path field.\r\n\r\n##Configuring Slum##\r\nIt is possible to change a lot of things in regards to Slum CMS, and that can be done in the config.php file. All of the possible configurations are commented, with descriptions of what it does, and what it can be changed to.\r\n\r\n##Uploading Images##\r\nSlum CMS does **not** upload images to the server it is located on. This is a planned feature. It is although possible to add images in the WYSIWYG editor, but they're uploaded to imgur, and not the server Slum is on.\r\n\r\n##Screenshots##\r\n###Dashboard for root user###\r\n![Dashboard for Root user][1]\r\n###Editing a page###\r\n![Editing page][2]\r\n\r\n##External Libraries##\r\nSlum CMS uses several external libraries, so as to function without reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\n###PHP Libraries###\r\n[Simple HTML DOM Parser](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/), used for parsing the selected pages and finding elements that has the .slum class.\r\n\r\n[NiceJSON-PHP](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/nicejson-php), used for outputting the JSON files in a pretty, readable format on older versions of PHP.\r\n\r\n[Tidier*](http://www.phpbuilder.com/snippet/detail.php?type=snippet&id=1348), used for outputting HTML in a pretty, readable format. (Does not have an official name, I just call it tidier in this project.)\r\n\r\n###JavaScript Libraries###\r\n[NicEdit](http://www.nicedit.com), is an easy to implement WYSIWYG-editor.\r\n\r\n###CSS Libraries###\r\n[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), is a nice \"library\", that makes it easy to achieve a simple, responsive layout.\r\n\r\n###License###\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Simon Klit.
